User Commands
=================

All commands that "normal" users of a Discord server can use are listed below.

Economy System
---------------

.. hint::
    With our economy system, you can collect as many diamonds as possible to stay one step ahead of other users!

- Collect diamonds daily with ``/diamond daily``
- Steal diamonds from other users with ``/diamond steal [member]``.
- Give other users a certain amount of diamonds: ``/diamond give [member] [amount] [description]`` -> amount = amount of diamonds, description = if you want to add a nice text.
- Use ``/diamond event`` to play an event to either win diamonds or lose diamonds. We wish you good luck!
- To get the statistics for a specific user, use ``/diamond balance``.
- To see the complete statistics of the economy game, use ``/diamond leaderboard``. There you can view the best players in the form of clear diagrams and also the best players with the longest streak! I wouldn't miss this if I were you! So what are you waiting for? Start with `/diamond daily` to create an economy game account in our economy database!

.. warning::
   If you try to steal diamonds from another user with ``/diamond steal [member]``, it can also happen that diamonds can be deducted from you.

Suggestion

You can build a fully functioning suggestion system for your server with our bot. The following explains how it all works.

    suggestion_id = Discord Message ID from the suggestion in the channel you want to reject or accept.
